# Declare two variables and print that which variable is largest using ternary operators

# Declare two variables
a = 10
b = 20

# Using a ternary operator to find and print the largest variable
largest = a if a > b else b

# Print the largest variable
print("The largest variable is:", largest)


# Output:

# The largest variable is: 20
